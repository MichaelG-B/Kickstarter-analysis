# An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends in marketability plays in the US
---
## Methods
- Organized/familiarized the data set via filters, conditional formatting, debugging etc.
- Visualized the data set via pivot tables, pivot charts, box plots, line graphs etc.
- Analyzed the data set via statistical analysis of the mean, median, lower/upper quartile ranges, standard deviation, inter-quartile range etc.

### Key Findings
- First: In the United States the most successful Kickstarter campaigns were those in the category of "Theater" with 490 being successful. Of those 490 successful campaigns 412 were specifically "Plays". This is great news for Louise as this shows very generally that her ambitions to develop a successful play in the US is almost certainly in reach within the existing market.

- Second: The timing for setting up her campaign, based on analysis of the kickstarter data indicates that the most successful launches were made in the month of May. June and July had roughly similar success rates, therefore Louise's ideal launch date for her campaign would be from May-June; the middle of the second fiscal quarter of the year.

- Lastly: Based on the statistical analyisis of both the total successful and failed US kickstarter campaigns for the subcategory "plays", a budget goal of $10,000 appears to be significantly high for a successful campaign. This assumption is based on a few factors. First the mean goal and upper quartile range for a successful campaign is around $5,000. This means that 75% of all successful "play" campaigns in the US have a goal of $5,000 or less; coupled with a median of $3,000 gives the data distribution a slight skew to the right a bad omen for Louise's proposed budget. Secondly, if we take a look at the failed campaign analysis we find that the mean and upper quartile range is around $10,000. This is a similar distribution compared to successful campaigns howeveer in this case it means that 75% of all failed "play" campaigns in the US have a goal of $10,000 or less; a median of $5,000 gives the data distribution a significant skew to the right meaning that there is hope for Louise's proposed budget if she can adjust to a much lower goal.

#### Recommendations
- Based on these key findings I would suggest that Louise continue to pursue a "play" production, and aim to launch a kickstarter campaign in the early summer months of May, June or July as this period sees the highest success rate. However, Louise will need to make adjustments concerning her budget, mainly decreasing her budget to atleast $5,000 to fit the reality of the market if she hopes to gain success.
